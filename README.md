# Digitap AI Encryption API Guide
## Introduction
Welcome to the Digitap AI Encryption API Guide. This document provides a comprehensive overview of how to securely encrypt and decrypt sensitive data using the JSON Web Encryption (JWE) standard in the context of the Digitap AI API. This API leverages RSA public and private keys for data encryption and decryption, ensuring that data remains confidential during transmission between clients and Digitap services.

If you're looking for a deeper understanding of the JWE standard and how encryption and decryption are implemented, please refer to our JWE Encryption Guide. This guide will give you essential background on how JWE works and how it protects data confidentiality.

Additionally, if you're ready to integrate with our Encryption/Decryption API, the details are provided in this document, offering a step-by-step walkthrough of the APIâ€™s endpoints and use cases.

## Overview
The Digitap AI Encryption API provides endpoints that enable secure encryption and decryption of payloads and responses. The API follows the JWE standard to ensure that sensitive data, such as user credentials or financial information, is transmitted securely between clients and Digitap.

## Key Features:
* **Encryption**: Securely encrypts payloads and responses using the JWE standard.
* **Decryption**: Decrypts encrypted data using RSA private keys.
* **RSA Key Management**: Public and private keys are managed per environment and client, ensuring tailored security.
