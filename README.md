# JSON Web Encryption (JWE) Guide

## Overview

JSON Web Encryption (JWE) is a standard that allows you to encrypt sensitive data in a secure manner. This guide provides an overview of the JWE encryption and decryption processes, applicable across various programming languages and platforms.

## What is JWE?

JWE is a part of the larger JSON Web Token (JWT) family of standards, which allows you to securely transmit data by encrypting the payload. JWE ensures that only the intended recipient can decrypt and read the data, making it ideal for securing sensitive information in transit.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Payload
The payload is the data you want to encrypt. It could be in JSON format, text, or any other structured data format.

### 2. Keys
- **Public Key**: Used to encrypt the payload. This key is publicly available and is used to ensure that only the intended recipient can decrypt the data.
- **Private Key**: Used to decrypt the payload. This key is kept secret by the recipient.

### 3. Header
The header contains metadata about the encryption process, including the algorithms used for encryption. It typically includes:
- `alg`: The algorithm used to encrypt the content encryption key (e.g., `RSA-OAEP-256`).
- `enc`: The algorithm used to encrypt the payload (e.g., `A256GCM`).

### 4. JWE Object
The JWE object is the final encrypted output, consisting of:
- **Protected Header**: Metadata about the encryption process.
- **Encrypted Key**: The encrypted content encryption key (CEK).
- **Initialization Vector (IV)**: Random data used to ensure encryption security.
- **Ciphertext**: The encrypted payload.
- **Authentication Tag**: Used to verify the integrity of the encrypted data.

## JWE Encryption Process

### 1. Prepare the Payload
Structure the data you wish to encrypt, such as a JSON object containing sensitive information.

### 2. Create the Header
Define a header specifying the algorithms used for encryption, such as:
```json
{
  "alg": "RSA-OAEP-256",
  "enc": "A256GCM"
}
