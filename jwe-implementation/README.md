# Digitap AI API Encryption Guide

## Introduction
This guide provides an overview of the **JSON Web Encryption (JWE)** standard, outlining how to securely encrypt and decrypt sensitive data. JWE is a crucial part of the larger **JSON Web Token (JWT)** framework, offering a method for protecting data during transmission. This guide covers the JWE encryption and decryption processes, applicable across different programming languages and platforms.

## What is JWE?
**JSON Web Encryption (JWE)** is a standard used to encrypt data in a way that ensures confidentiality. It allows data to be securely transmitted over potentially insecure channels, where only the intended recipient can decrypt and access the information. JWE is a fundamental tool for secure data transmission, particularly in APIs, web services, and applications that need to handle sensitive information.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Payload
The payload is the data you wish to protect. It can be in various formats, such as:

- JSON objects
- Text
- Binary data
- 
This is the actual content being encrypted.

### 2. Keys
- **Public Key**: This key is used for encrypting the payload and is available to anyone who needs to send encrypted data. Only the recipient can decrypt the data using their corresponding private key.
- **Private Key**: Kept secret by the recipient, this key is used to decrypt the encrypted payload.

### 3. Header
The header contains metadata about the encryption, including the encryption algorithms used. It typically includes:

- `alg`: The algorithm used to encrypt the content encryption key (e.g., `RSA-OAEP-256`).
- `enc`: The algorithm used to encrypt the payload (e.g., `A256GCM`).

### 4. JWE Object
The JWE object represents the final encrypted output, and it is composed of:

- **Protected Header**: Encodes metadata about the encryption process.
- **Encrypted Key**: The content encryption key (CEK) encrypted using the public key.
- **Initialization Vector (IV)**: Random data used to ensure the encryption's security and uniqueness.
- **Ciphertext**: The actual encrypted payload, which is the protected data.
- **Authentication Tag**: A tag used to verify the integrity of the encrypted data, ensuring it hasn't been tampered with.

## JWE Encryption Process
### 1. Prepare the Payload
The first step is to structure the data to be encrypted. This could include sensitive information like user credentials, financial data, or any other confidential content. The payload can be in a variety of formats, such as a JSON object.

### 2. Create the Header
The header defines the encryption parameters and specifies the algorithms used. Here's an example of how you might define a header for JWE:

```json
{
  "alg": "RSA-OAEP-256",
  "enc": "A256GCM"
}
```
In this example:

- `alg` refers to the algorithm used to encrypt the content encryption key (CEK), in this case, **RSA-OAEP-256**.
- `enc` indicates the algorithm used to encrypt the payload itself, in this case, **A256GCM** (Advanced Encryption Standard with Galois/Counter Mode).

These parameters ensure the data is encrypted securely and according to established cryptographic standards.
